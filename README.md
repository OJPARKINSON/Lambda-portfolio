# Lambda-portfolio

This repositry is split into two parts, the first a Lambda API that gets the lastest stock prices and the second is the Rasberrry Pi diplay code that uses the api.

A Lambda API that uses the [Coinbase API](https://docs.pro.coinbase.com/) and the [iexcloud API](https://iexcloud.io/docs/api/]).

The Lambda API was first wrritten in JavaScript and then rewritten in GoLang to gain more experiance with the language.
